Spook
=====

This is an OOP JavaScript/jQuery game using jQuery. It's still in the works.

But it's very simple to use. Simply clone the files to your local repo, and run the html file "Spook.html". It works best on Chrome, and you'll be able to interact with Spook.

The right/left buttons move him...right or left. The Shift+up button makes him jump. Be careful of ice, because he will slip. Have fun!
