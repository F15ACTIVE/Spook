Spook
=====

This is an OOP JavaScript/jQuery game about an eyeball with two feet who doesn't have very far to go, because the game isn't finished yet.

But it's very simple to use. Simply clone the files to your local repo, and run the html file "Spook.html". It works best on Chrome, and you'll be able to interact with Spook.

The right/left buttons move him...right or left. The Shift+up button makes him jump. Be careful of ice, because he will slip. Have fun!
